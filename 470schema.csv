Bids must include all charges, including equipment costs itemized by component, shipping, and any surcharges. 
The vendor must indicate whether the licenses and operating system software for internal connection equipment are classified as maintenance or internal connections. 
All bids must include the Service Provider Identification Number (SPIN/Form 498 ID) and address all requested services; otherwise, the bid will be disqualified. E-rate eligible costs will be the primary factor in the bid evaluation; however, other factors will also be considered, including prior experience with the vendor. Additional points will be awarded to vendors that apply SPI/474 discounts on their invoices. Pricing should reflect the Lowest Corresponding Price and any discounts available to governmental units.

We are seeking 3 year contract options. 3 year contracts should allow for upgrades to quoted bandwidth throughout the terms of the contract.  If an increase in bandwidth is requested during the contract period the contract does not renew. All solutions should include installation and initial configuration, a method to report service outages and receive basic technical support without additional service fees, and a service level agreement.
All solutions can include special construction or one-time E-rate eligible non-recurring costs as well as E-rate eligible recurring circuit costs. Any special construction pricing should be separated from any MRC.  Based on the bids and both a short term and long term cost effectiveness analysis, we will determine which of the solutions is acceptable.  Failure to include any requested information in the previous paragraph is grounds for disqualification.
Prices should be all inclusive. All inclusive in this case means, including all special construction or non-recurring costs (NRC) required by the vendor to commence service and all monthly recurring costs (MRC) should be included. We would prefer the option available under E-rate rules to amortize the non-discounted portion of any special construction costs over four years or the life of the contract, if the contract is shorter than four years.","Red Top Meadows is seeking proposals to replace aging network hardware and internal wiring.

The district is not requesting MIBS for BMIC for its existing network equipment. The option existing equipment for MIBS was selected only because a drop down on the 470 for new equipment was not available. Licensing for new equipment is often considered by USAC to have a component which it considered to be Basic Maintenance of Internal Connections or Managed Internal Broadband Services, which is the only reason BMIC & MIBS are listed on this Form 470. Line item for Antennas, Connectors, and Related Components is for any connectors needed for the requested Internal Connections on this application to connect and function per district specifications.",,,,Yes,Yes,"PA procurement regulations apply. Please refer to RFP document for specific instructions.

A final decision regarding speed and specifc technology will be at the school's discretion. 
 	
In response to curriculum using more online resources and online applications are becoming more bandwidth-intensive, the school is seeking a growth path for all services. Vendors with multiple o ers in the same product line should o er discounts so the school can move up and down the product line during the contract's life. It would be advisable to present pricing on the array of services, so while under contract the school can migrate easily without negotiating a new contract. All services should be installed so billing is e effective no sooner than July 1, 2016. Pricing should include IN the proposal the recurring, installation (labor and materials), and any construction costs or it will disqualify a vendor. NO offer will be accepted without the construction cost stated upfront. Terms and conditions should include: 
 
1)	Business Downturn clause to eliminate termination liability or provide protection from penalties, if enrollment declines requiring a significant change in services or end of service. 
2)	Monthly to multi-year (1,3 and 5 years) agreements with options to renew or accept voluntary extensions. 
3)	The choice in your contract for the client to proceed with or without E Rate funding or to decline the product/service if Erate doesn't fund the school in that area.

Lit fiber service is for 20 Gbps per circuit and dark fiber service is for either 1 pair (2 strands) or 2 pairs (4 strands) of fibers to connect 27 buildings, for either a 5 year or 10 year initial term with 5 years of extension options. In creating a network design to fulfill the requirements of this RFP, Vendors are strongly encouraged to leverage and incorporate existing fiber facilities in their proposals, either through direct ownership or through third party subcontract relationships. The expectation is that the price of service that leverages existing resources will be more cost-effective and more capable of being timely implemented than proposals that require significant construction of new facilities.

Please note that the RFP requests 20 Gbps of lit fiber service but the 470 filing system does not provide that option and the closest option is 25 Gbps.  The 50 Gbps option as the maximum lit fiber bandwidth is to contemplate growth and expanded need that may arise during the term of the agreement.

Service should be terminated at Yaak School, 29893 Yaak River Rd, Troy, MT 59935.  Pricing should be included for 100Mbps increments from the minimum to the maximum bandwidths noted above.  We are seeking 1 , 3 or 5 year contract options. 3 or 5 year contracts should allow for upgrades to quoted bandwidth throughout the terms of the contract.  If an increase in bandwidth is requested during the contract period the contract does not renew. All solutions should include installation and initial configuration (if needed), a method to report service outages and receive basic technical support without additional service fees, and a service level agreement.

All solutions can include special construction or one-time E-rate eligible non-recurring costs as well as E-rate eligible recurring circuit costs. Based on the bids and both a short term and long term cost effectiveness analysis, we will determine which of the solutions is acceptable.  Failure to include any requested information in the previous paragraph is grounds for disqualification.

Prices should be all-inclusive. All inclusive in this case means, including all special construction or non-recurring costs (NRC) required by the vendor to commence service and all monthly recurring costs (MRC) should be included. We would prefer the option available under E-rate rules to amortize the non-discounted portion of any special construction costs over four years or the life of the contract, if the contract is shorter than four years.

Service implementation for all solutions is dependent on receipt of an E-rate funding commitment letter.  For any solutions requiring special construction, service implementation is also dependent on award of state matching funds from Montana State Matching fund as laid out in HB 390 and Mont. Code Ann. Â§200-534

To ensure proper distribution and equitable access to all students, we are procuring 2 (two) 48 port POE switches, a 10Gbps copper or fiber connection, 6 WAPs and a small caching server.

Service should be terminated at 701 Plainfield Rd. Downers Grove, IL 60516.  Pricing should be included for 1Gbps increments from the minimum to the maximum bandwidths noted above.  We are seeking 1, 3, and 5-year contract options.  3 or 5-year contracts should allow for upgrades to quoted bandwidth throughout the terms of the contract.  If an increase in bandwidth is requested during the contract period the contract does not renew. All solutions should include installation and initial configuration (if needed), a method to report service outages and receive basic technical support without additional service fees, and a service level agreement.

All solutions can include special construction or one-time E-rate eligible non-recurring costs as well as E-rate eligible recurring circuit costs. Based on the bids and both a short-term and long-term cost-effectiveness analysis, we will determine which of the solutions is acceptable.  Failure to include any requested information in the previous paragraph is grounds for disqualification.

Prices should be all-inclusive. All inclusive in this case means, including all special construction or non-recurring costs (NRC) required by the vendor to commence service and all monthly recurring costs (MRC) should be included. We would prefer the option available under E-rate rules to amortize the non-discounted portion of any special construction costs over four years or the life of the contract, if the contract is shorter than four years.

Service implementation for all solutions is dependent on receipt of an E-rate funding commitment letter.  For any solutions requiring special construction, service implementation is also dependent on award of state matching funds from ISBE Illinois state match fund.

Internet Access: 
Plumas Lake Elementary School District hereafter referred to as Applicant, is requesting proposals for leased lit fiber (with or without Internet access) for delivery of wide area network (WAN) services to the district. Service is expected to originate at the district hub site and be delivered to the eligible service locations. All locations, with addresses, are listed in the attached pricing sheet. The new service is being planned to begin on July 1, 2019 which represents the expiration of the current WAN service.
Applicant is seeking bids for a fully managed WAN solution. Leased Lit Fiber (with or without Internet Access) is the E-rate Category 1 service option to choose when bidding point to point wide area network (WAN) connections.  WAN connections do not connect to an Internet access point.   WAN connections are point-to-point fiber connections that connect individual instructional/non-instructional facilities in the same school district. 
Network Design and Construction Routes -
a.	Applicant will consider traditional network designs (such as hub and spoke) or alternative proposals. The applicantâ€™s stated decision criteria (outlined in the RFP) will be used to determine if an award is made as-a-result of this RFP.  The applicant has, in accordance with E-rate guidelines, rated cost of service as the highest weighted factor in its decision criteria.
b.	Due to current and future bandwidth needs, respondents are encouraged to provide dedicated infrastructure to Applicant. Designs are encouraged to utilize the private fiber approach, where there exists no other aggregation or third-party equipment on fiber strands between sites and modulating equipment at each site is dedicated to Applicant and not shared in any way with other customers. If this is not possible, then designs should limit the use of shared infrastructure as much as possible.	
c.   Respondents should clearly illustrate proposed network design and construction routes. 
d.	Applicant is not advocating or mandating any preconceived network design or construction route and leaves this decision up to the vendor to present their best solution while recognizing the cited termination locations.

Nodal WAN connection between all sites â€“ 1G with the ability for all sites to talk to each other.
No internet access is required as it is being provided to the District Office through Yuba City at no cost to the applicant.

Bidders shall offer Month-to-Month and multi-year contract options with no more than 3 years preferred. Three-year contract desirable with annual option to renew for up to two additional years. 
Bidders shall offer pricing in 100Mbps increments up to 2G.  Contract must allow for upgrades to quoted bandwidth.  
Proposals not offering all service speeds requested will be disqualified. 
Bidders shall quote all applicable charges including taxes, surcharges and other fees. 
Bids must identify the estimated cost for all non-recurring expenses, including but not limited to site surveys, project management, documentation, installation, configuration, taxes, etc. Prices must be broken down into eligible and ineligible charges.","*****************See RFP for all Details *********************************************** 
The School is seeking UPS, Wireless Access points, Licensing, and Basic Maintenance which include the ability to monitor and control devices in real-time through a web-based platform. Bids must include recommended accessories and parts for all E-Rate eligible quoted equipment, such as switch stacking cables, power adapters, cables, etc.
