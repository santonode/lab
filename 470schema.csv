Our preferred manufacturer is Cisco Systems. Equivalent proposals must be comparable in quantity and functionality and must be fully interoperable with our existing library equipment. Bids for an alternative manufacturer must also provide detailed explanations that the equipment included in the proposal is equivalent to that of the preferred manufacturer. The bid specification sheet for the alternative manufacturer's equipment must be included in the bid. Alternative manufacturer equipment proposals that do not include this information will be rejected due to failure to comply with the minimum bid requirements. 
Bids must include all charges, including equipment costs itemized by component, shipping, and any surcharges. 
The vendor must indicate whether the licenses and operating system software for internal connection equipment are classified as maintenance or internal connections. 
All bids must include the Service Provider Identification Number (SPIN/Form 498 ID) and address all requested services; otherwise, the bid will be disqualified. E-rate eligible costs will be the primary factor in the bid evaluation; however, other factors will also be considered, including prior experience with the vendor. Additional points will be awarded to vendors that apply SPI/474 discounts on their invoices. Pricing should reflect the Lowest Corresponding Price and any discounts available to governmental units.
